    "1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.\n",
    "* :- arithmetic operator for multiplication \n",
    "'hello' :- string value\n",
    "-87.8 :- float value\n",
    "- :- arithmetic operator for subtraction\n",
    "/  :- arithmetic operator for true division\n",
    "+\t:- arithmetic operator for addition\n",
    "6  :- integer value\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "Ans:- String:-  String is a series of character. We use  double and single quote for string. In the  quotes very thing is a string.\n",
    "Example of string:- “This is a string.”  And ‘This is also a string.’\n",
    "Variable:- Variable is use for store data in itself. And we can use this data by the only variable name in the future. Simply we assign a value and data to a variable . And we can make a variable name by our choice what we store in that variable.\n",
    "Example of a Variable:- name = “Hemant chaudhary” and number = 8256823589 like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Describe three different data types.\n",
    "Integer Data Type:-  Integer data type is store whole numbers. There is no decimal value in it. Example:- 7,34,4,35,e.t.c \n",
    "Floats Data Type:- Float is used for real numbers with decimal which separate the integer and fractional part. Like 89.35,949.948,e.t.c\n",
    "Complex Data Type:- it is a combination of a imaginary and a real number. It’s first part is real and second part is imaginary.\n",
    "Like:- a = 2+3j. Here 2.0 is a real part and 3.0 is imaginary part\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?\n",
    "Ans:- Expression is made up of a combination of a operator and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value. Expression can we arithmetic ,logical or relational. In the programming language , expression is evaluated as per the precedence of its operators. Like:- z = x+y, a>b, a == b\n",
    "Expression is do a some operation for given value and produce some output like:-\n",
    "A = 7+8 in this expression 7 and 8 is added with the help of a arithmetic operator and the final value of a is 15.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "1. A statement is used for creating variables or for displaying values. \n",
    "   The expression produces some value or result after being interpreted.\n",
    "2. A statement is not evaluated for some results.\n",
    "    A expression is evaluated for some result.\n",
    "3. A statement can be a expression.\n",
    " An expression is not a statement.\n",
    "Example:- Statement:- b = 7.\n",
    "                   Expression:- a = 45*78.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "bacon = 22\n",
    "bacon + 1\n",
    "Ans: bacon contain 22.\n",
    "7. What should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "'spam' + 'spamspam' = ‘spamspamspam’\n",
    "'spam' * 3 = ‘spamspamspam’\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "Ans:- Eggs is valid variable name because variable name can be start with the alphabets . 100 is invalid because variable name cannot start with the numbers. It is invalid in programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?\n",
    "Ans:- int():- this function is used for to get a integer value.\n",
    "float():- this function is used for to get a floating-point number.\n",
    "Str():- this function is used for to get a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?\n",
    "'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.' :- in this expression 99 is considered as a integer and in python integer and string is not concatenate . only string can be concatenate.\n",
    "The correct form of this is :- ‘I have eaten ‘ + ‘99’ + ‘burritos’ now 99 is act as a string because we use single quote for 99.\n",
    "\n",
